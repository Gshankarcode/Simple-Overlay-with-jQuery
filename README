After including the simpleOverlay.css and simpleOverlay.js files in your HTML page you can trigger an overlay as below. Obviously being a jQuery plugin, you must include the jQuery library as well.

This is an example of how to create an overlay once the plugin has been added, this would trigger the overlay when you click on a div element with the class button.

$('div.button').click(function (e) {

var content = '<p style="height:400px; width:400px; padding:25px;">OverlayContent</p>';
			
     var overlay = new simpleOverlay.Overlay({
	triggerEvent: e,
	ajaxContent: false,
	content: content
     });
			
});

If you wanted to populate the overlay with content returned after an AJAX call, you would do this:
			
			var overlay = new simpleOverlay.Overlay({
				triggerEvent: e,
				ajaxContent: true
			});
			
			overlay.Populate(contentToPopulateWith);
			
The overlay will then animate and resize itself accordingly, the overlay also has functions such as overlay.SetWorking() and overlay.FinishWorking() to apply a wash over the content currently in the overlay and to display a loading spinner image. This is done by default when an ajaxContent is true, when the content is recieved by the overlay it will remove this spinner automatically.
